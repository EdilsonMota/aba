## Learned Lessons
- It's better to use a front-end frame work for data biding between HTML and CSS. Obviously!
- "Respect the process", try to build something not strutured is the worst, and must time consuming method especially on the front-end so design first and code after your at least satisfied with the result.
- "Refactury takes time", when it comes to CSS selector be pantient and come up with significante names. Replacing a class name is mutch easier then having to come um up with a new CSS selector rule.
- Making it dinamic with JavaScript is cool, but there is no reward in making a componente that can be copied or installed.
